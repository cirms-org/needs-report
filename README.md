## Executive Summary

### Mission

The Council on Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards (CIRMS) is an
independent, non-profit organization that draws together stakeholders from
government, industry and academia to discuss, review and assess national needs
in the field of ionizing radiation to enhance societal benefits.

### Vision

CIRMS seeks to inform the national debate on issues involving ionizing radiation
to make policy recommendations based on the interplay among fundamental
scientific advancement, practical implementation of ionizing radiation
technologies and governmental rules and regulations to ensure public safety. To
achieve these ends, CIRMS seeks to organize expert opinion in focus areas: 1)
medical applications, 2) radiation safety and security, and 3) industrial
applications and materials effects.

### Dynamic Needs Report

Through this online repository, CIRMS seeks to engage the community with the
thoughtful insights and the results of vigorous discussions at our annual
meetings and throughout the year. The goals of the Dynamic Needs Report is to
track and keep up-to-date needs in the community that represent:

1. areas in which federal regulations are insufficient to deal with rapidly
   evolving technologies;

2. areas which member companies have identified as fertile areas for academia
   research which could lead to compelling graduate theses;

3. areas in which national, state or local funding priorities seems to be
   mis-prioritized to address the mission of CIRMS; and

4. areas in logistics and critical infrastructure which limit CIRMS and its
   affiliate labs, companies and academics from having access to traceable
   measurement standards in fields related to ionizing radiation.

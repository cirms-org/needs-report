# Metrology Needs

Each of the subcommittees of the CIRMS Science and Technology Committee has
prepared a series of Measurement Program Descriptions (MPDs) pertinent to their
area of expertise. These were arrived at through dialogue at CIRMS meetings and
workshops. The MPDs are designated by letter apropos to subcommittee areas of
interest:

`A` [Medical Applications](medical-applications/medical-applications.md)

`B` [Public and Environmental Protection](safety-security/safety-security.md)

`C` [Occupational Radiation Protection](safety-security/safety-security.md)

`D` [Industrial Applications and Materials Effects](industrial-material/industrial-material.md)

`E` [Homeland Security](safety-security/safety-security.md)

`F` [Mathematical modeling](mathematical-modeling/mathematical-modeling.md)

Numbers are assigned to MDPs as they evolved with the last digit indicating the
latest revision of an existing MPD with its first issuance starting at zero.
MPDs tend to be living working documents that are changed by the subcommittees
of the CIRMS Science and Technology Committee as some aspects are completed and
others perceived as in need of attention. MPD A.7.3, for example, is a seventh
MPD generated by the Medical Applications subcommittee in its fourth revision.
One or two page MPD’s for these various areas are presented below.

The CIRMS Medical Applications subcommittee deals with diagnostic and
therapeutic uses of ionizing radiation, whether isotope or accelerator
sourced radiation. New topics of interest involve the growing use of
proton beam therapy for more targeted cancer treatment and a need for
enhanced dosimetry systems to quantify exposure levels in computerized
tomography scans (CT scans). An introduction to the overall areas of
interest in the medical area in the use of ionizing radiation can be
found in ([Appendix D](Appendix_D "wikilink")). This was taken from the
fourth “Needs Report” of December 2004. More complete details on all of
the MPD’s generated by the CIRMS Medical Applications subcommittee can
be found in PDF form in prior “Needs Reports” which are accessible on
the CIRMS web site: www.cirms.org [1](http://www.cirms.org).

CIRMS has been very effective in the Medical Applications area by
drawing together professionals from the academic and medical
communities, from the US FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (CDRH), and by involvement of the National Institutes of Health,
in particular the National Cancer Institute, and of inter-agency groups
such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
(BARDA). One of CIRMS early success stories (MPD A.1.0 - [National
Air-Kerma Standards for
Mammography](National_Air-Kerma_Standards_for_Mammography "wikilink"))
was the organization’s ability to pull together of various agencies to
cofund a needed radiation target facility at NIST so that air-kerma
measurements for mammography equipment could be calibrated.

NIST, through the guidance of the CIRMS Medical Applications
subcommittee, has also established radioactivity standards for nuclear
medicine (MPD A.2.3) and for determining the absorbed dose-to-water for
photon external beam radiation therapy (MPD A.4.1 -
[Absorbed-Dose-to-Water Standards for Photon External Beam Radiation
Therapy](Absorbed-Dose-to-Water_Standards_for_Photon_External_Beam_Radiation_Therapy "wikilink")).
National standards for the air-kerma measurements of diagnostic X-ray
beams (MPD A.5.0 - [Air Kerma National Standards for Diagnostic X-ray
Beams](Air_Kerma_National_Standards_for_Diagnostic_X-ray_Beams "wikilink"))
and for the air kerma strength of photons emitted by brachytherapy
sources (MPD A.6.0 - [National Air Kerma Strength Standards for Photon
Brachytherapy
Sources](National_Air_Kerma_Strength_Standards_for_Photon_Brachytherapy_Sources "wikilink"))
have also been established. NIST has obtained equipment, such as a
medical linear accelerator, to facilitate these activities. Below is a
list of the completed Measurement Program Descriptions prepared by the
CIRMS Medical Applications subcommittee. One or two page descriptions of
the active MPDs follow. These present the objectives, some background
information and needs in each active area.

# `D.08.2` High-Energy Electron Beam Dosimetry

## Objective

- Develop a facility for NIST to support new jobs in advanced manufacturing
based on high-energy electron beam dosimetry.

## Actions

- [ ] (Proposed 2012) NIST should approve a seed grant to fund a planning team to
assess current industry uses of high-energy electron beams and make predictions
about future needs to address both current and emerging advanced manufacturing
needs.

- [ ] (Proposed 2012) Pending success of previous action, NIST would need to
marshal resources to support personnel and facilities upgrades such as
shielding to utilize capital assets (e-beam accelerators) currently in storage
to keep up with the changing needs of industry.

## Requirements

## Background

- Advanced Manufacturing
- Current Capabilities at NIST

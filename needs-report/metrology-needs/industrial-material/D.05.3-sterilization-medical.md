# `D.05.3` Medical Device Sterilization

## Objective

- Promulgate NIST traceable empirically verified protocols for gamma and
electron beam dosimetry used in medical device sterilization.

## Actions

- [ ] Link to efforts of MPD D.8.2 [High-energy Electron Beam
Dosimetry](High-energy_Electron_Beam_Dosimetry "wikilink") to ensure medical
sterilization is a considered metric. (Proposed in 2012)

- [ ] Derive a pilot structure for a proficiency test that measures how
effectively facilities can deliver a specified dose. This will be based
initially on a handful of companies to develop and refine a protocol. Upon
initial completion, this will be opened to the larger community. (Proposed in 2012)

- [ ] Develop an industry recognized, broadly based standard method of test
based upon the infra-red analysis of the development of the transvinylene
content in polyethylene. This too must be subjected to inter-laboratory studies
in order to determine the precision of this method. (Proposed in 2011)

## Requirements

- [ ] A multi-national dosimetry task force should be formed to implement the
above action items. This will require several person years of commitment over
at least a three year time frame.

## Background

The high growth medical device industry relies on a diversity of material
constructions to perform unique and sometimes intricate functions. Radiation
sterilization has gained increased acceptance as a fast and efficacious means
for assuring the absence of any microbial contamination on such devices. Items
as mundane as cotton balls and bandages to sophisticated transdermal drug
delivery systems, wound care treatment coverings and complex plastic filtration
units are being sterilized by radiation processes. Almost all major producers
of medical devices and numerous small companies use radiation sterilization in
their device manufacturing processes. Although in the United States the Food
and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health does not
prescribe a preferred means for attaining sterility, it does require that
medical devices be made under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and in
doing so requires a complete protocol of record keeping, traceability, written
procedures and the like. For sterilization, the FDA has accepted the standards
and guidelines established by the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (ww.aami.org). These along with specific dosimetry test methods
and procedures developed by the ASTM International (www.astm.org) provide
guidance to the practitioner of radiation sterilization to justify claims of
product sterility and to do so within the context of GMP protocols. ASTM
International lists about twelve different dosimetry methods which can be used
to infer dose. However, there is no database founded on inter-laboratory
testing to confirm the viability of these standards for commercial use and
guide the end-user to apropos dosimeter selection based on data. This leaves
the user with an incoherent metrology system and renders the user subject to
competing vendor claims.

The International Atomic Energy Agency’s Collaborating Center for Radiation
Processing and Industrial Dosimetry has conducted two inter-laboratory studies
involving nine laboratories. These inter-laboratory tests showed that only
alanine dosimeters would be suitable as reference and transfer dosimeters
amongst laboratories. Other published results have shown that in particular
film dosimeters based on photo-chromatic changes of dyes in films to be
unstable and are not made to a modicum of industrial film quality. Thus, only
alanine, whether in pellet form or coated onto films, is suitable for
indicating compliance with any “dose” requirements. Other methodologies may be
suitable for internal process control, but not for reference purposes.

The ASTM International committee F04 on Medical and Surgical Materials
and Devices has developed a Standard Method of Test which can be used to
infer “dose” based upon the development of a transvinylene double bond
in polyethylene (ASTM standard F-2381). This technique, the use of
infra-red analysis to determine transvinylene double bonds in
polyethylene, is also used as the in-house control method by the two
largest users of industrial electron beam processing. The observation of
the transvinylene development in polyethylene goes back to the late
1950’s when it was first found that polyethylene would cross-link when
exposed to ionizing radiation from an electron beam. Since transvinylene
infra-red analysis technique has been successfully used by the major
users of EB processing and has been adopted as a standard by the medical
device community itself, a more broadly based standard should be
developed which would be supported by inter-laboratory studies. The
infra-red equipment needed for this type of analysis is less costly than
the equipment needed to determine the spin resonance in alanine.

### Discussion Topics

- [ ] Conduct more broadly based inter-laboratory international studies on the
use of alanine as the appropriate reference dosimeter and publish the resulting
database.

- [ ] Investigate the use of two real-time dosimetry systems currently
available in the market (`Monitorad` and `Cdose`) and examine the use of
transistors as real-time dosimetry systems as well as other possible
semiconductor and optoelectronic devices.

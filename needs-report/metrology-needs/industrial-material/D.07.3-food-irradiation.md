# `C.07.3` Forum for Access to Specialty Tools in IRMS

## Objective

- Establish NIST traceable protocols to calibrate and verify dosimetry for all
aspects of the food irradiation process.

- Establish protocols to quantify the biological effects of food irradiation.

## Actions

- [ ] Catalog current available information on the food irradiation process now
available from the USDA, FDA, WHO and other resources and post links to web
sites on the CIRMS web page. In so doing, establish a network of collaboration
amongst food industry technologists, the irradiation processing industry and
academia, to develop a database covering the different levels of sensitivity
(injury, recovery, and repair) of food pathogens to the effect of physical
chemical variables (pH, temperature, food composition, nutrition, oxygen, dose
and dose rate). The complex array of presently available information on the
internet warrants a focused coordination. Such focus could be brought with
apropos links on the CIRMS web-site.

- [ ] Conduct a workshop with the food processing industry and those involved
in food irradiation to explain the implications of dose on the reduction and
elimination of biological burden.

- [ ] In collaboration with processors currently engaged in irradiating food,
assess various dosimetry techniques and prepare a consensus report on a
preferred dosimetry method of test for establishing dose for irradiated food
and related packaging materials and on dose-mapping techniques that can be used
for verifying depth-dose penetration in the broad spectrum of densities
encountered in food products.

- [ ] Include aspects of food packaging materials irradiation in such report,
such as work being conducted within the Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI)
in its Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Packaging Materials Committee (FDCPMC) on
irradiation effects on packaging materials for food that will be irradiated in
its package.

- [ ] Utilize complementary methodologies being developed for dosimetry
metrology for medical device sterilization (MPD C.5.3).

- [ ] Using Monte Carlo calculations, determine the dose distributions for
heterogeneous food product packages, such as boxes of chicken wings with their
bones for the different modalities which can be used as sources for ionizing
radiation, (gamma ray, electron beam and X-ray). Confirm such determinations
with empirical dosimetry studies, giving emphasis to the precision of the
$D_\text{min}$ and $D_\text{max}$ ratios attainable per mass or type of package
of food product.

- [ ] Catalog available information on the characterization of the occurrence
and magnitude of a recovery phenomenon for microorganisms following irradiation
and, at the research level, investigate the ability to mathematically model the
degree of lethal and potentially-lethal injures to micro-organisms due to
irradiation, noting such factors as dose and dose rate.

## Requirements

- [ ] A specific person, possibly within a government or university
laboratory, is needed to coordinate and gather information on all of the
various aspects of food irradiation, including developments in
understanding the fundamental biochemistry underlying of the effects of
ionizing radiation on food, as well as implications on dosimetry
calibration services posed by the food irradiation process. This should
be a full time effort, not taken on as an additional work assignment. A
minimum of one person-year per year over the next three years time
interval is needed.

- [ ] Retain outside consulting services as needed to supplement NIST
commitments in this area.

## Background

Increased concerns about the overall safety of the food supply chain in North
America have, in the United States, empowered the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) with greater
inspection authority and the demand for improved methods of detection of
contaminants and pathogens in foodstuffs. Outbreaks of food-borne illness
resulting from Listeria, Salmonella and E. coli contamination, have spurred
support for these measures from food industry groups. Thus, there is a renewed
interest in the use of ionizing radiation as a method to control pathogens in
food products.

# Industrial Applications and Materials Effects

In the industrial area, high current electron beams are used in the manufacture
of diverse products ranging from crosslinked wire and cable jacketing, as in
under-the-hood automotive wiring and aircraft wiring, heat shrinkable tubing and
food packaging films, tire components, and in the drying of inks, coatings and
adhesives that are made from reactive materials which effectively eliminate air
pollutants. Long lived isotopes, such as cobalt-60 (half life of about 5.2714
years) or cesium-137 (half life of about 30.17 years), or alternatively x rays
derived from high powered electron beam accelerators, are used to sterilize
medical devices and hold out the long-promised hope for sanitizing food and
eliminating food-borne pathogens such as e-coli and salmonella, which have
caused numerous illnesses and deaths resulting in costly recalls of meats,
produce, eggs, etc.

The CIRMS Industrial Applications and Materials Effects (IAME) subcommittee
deals with diverse uses of ionizing radiation in a myriad of industrial
processes. For the most part, these are high speed, energy efficient processes.
There are over 1700 high current electron beam accelerators used by industry to
produce value added products, whose cumulative value has been estimated at least
\$75 billion US dollars. The insulation and jacketing on wire and cable are EB
crosslinked to enhance flame retardancy, such as in under-the-hood wiring and
aircraft wiring. Tire manufacturers use EB processing in order to control the
placement and stability of tire cords when they are molded into a finished tire.
Heat shrinkable tubing is used to protect electrical connections; heat
shrinkable wrap-around materials protect the connections in the
telecommunications industry. Impervious food packaging films that recover their
original shape upon heating are produced using EB crosslinking. Low-energy,
self-shielded units are used to convert reactive liquid materials to produce dry
inks, coatings and adhesives with near-zero volatile organic emissions, a
“green” process technology. Pathogens on medical devices or in or on foodstuffs
are eliminated by using ionizing radiation from either radioactive cobalt-60
sources or electron beams. The FDA and USDA have approved the use of this
technology in order to protect the food supply and increase food safety. The
development of very powerful electron beam accelerators has made x rays derived
from these sources a viable alternative to isotope use in the industrial area.
Irradiation in the space environment and of the effects of radiation on the
containment vessels of nuclear power plants are also concerns of this
subcommittee. Background on the overall metrology areas of interest in the
industrial area is in Appendix G. The Industrial Applications and Materials
Effects MPDs are listed below. One page descriptions of the active MPDs follow
in a separate section. These present the objectives, some background information
and needs in each active area.

# `A.01` National Air-Kerma Standards for Mammography

## Summary for MPD A.01 (Completed)

In 1992, the US Congress passed Public Law 102 530, the Mammography Quality
Standards Act of 1992. This Act requires that all screening and diagnostic
mammographic facilities be certified by the Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services by October 1, 1994. This certification process will
involve accreditation by an approved nonprofit private organization or approved
State organization. There must be a yearly on site evaluation by a credentialed
medical physicist and a yearly inspection by a credentialed government
inspector.

## Detailed Program Characteristics

Mammographic units used in the United States commonly use molybdenum for both
the X ray tube anode material and the additional filter used to remove unwanted
low energy bremsstrahlung X-rays that contribute to patient dose but not
significantly to image quality. One problem in calibrating instruments used to
measure the air-kerma rate from mammographic units is that the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presently does not yet have a
national standard for those mammographic beams. In fact, the only national
standards laboratory in the world having appropriate national standards is the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the German standards laboratory.
All the reference X ray beams at NIST are produced by tungsten-anode X ray
tubes. The spectra (and therefore any measure of beam quality) are quite
different for these two anode materials. For a tungsten target, aluminum filter
system operated at voltages appropriate for mammography, most of the dose
results from the thick-target tungsten bremsstrahlung (i.e., low energy X-rays),
although the L fluorescent tungsten X-rays are present. For a molybdenum target,
molybdenum filter system, the K fluorescent X- rays dominate the spectra and
there is very little thick-target molybdenum bremsstrahlung. For a reasonable
choice of operating voltages, one can match either the half value layer or the
homogeneity coefficient but not both beam quality parameters for molybdenum
anodes.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for calibrating all the instruments
that the government inspectors will use during the yearly inspection of each
mammography facility. The CDRH X ray Calibration Laboratory is accredited by
NIST’s National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program. CDRH is establishing
a new facility within the Mammography Calibration Laboratory explicitly to
calibrate instruments in appropriate X ray beams. Since there are no suitable
national standards in the United States, CDRH has opted to send its reference
ionization chamber to PTB to establish traceability to a national standard.

To perform the annual on site evaluation, the medical physicists will presumably
have their instruments calibrated at one of the American Association of
Physicists in Medicine’s (AAPM) Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratories
(ADCL). One of these laboratories, at the University of Wisconsin, is developing
a free-air chamber to measure air kerma from their mammography X ray units. In
principle, the free-air chamber is an absolute device, but in practice it is
necessary to determine a number of correction factors. Preliminary comparisons
of this chamber with NIST standards have been made in tungsten-anode beams, and
measurements of selected mammography chamber response have been made in the
molybdenum and rhodium beams at CDRH.

To be able to provide national standards for all secondary laboratories wishing
to calibrate mammography probes, it is desirable for NIST to develop suitable
reference X ray beams. An Interagency Agreement has been established with the
Food and Drug Administration to develop these national standards. At a minimum,
these new reference beams should be identical to the beams recommended by the
International Electrotechnical Commission for measuring the characteristics of
diagnostic X ray equipment and for verifying the performance requirements of
ionization chambers and semiconductors used in medical radiography.

## US Facilities, Staffing, and Funding

The appropriate US facilities can be organized into three groups:

1. **NIST:** As indicated above, NIST needs major new resources in
equipment and personnel to carry out this program. With the tight
deadlines of MQSA, this program needs high priority. A minimum
requirement is 2 person-years and \$250,000 for each of two years.

2. **CDRH:** Most equipment for the new mammography facility has been
ordered. Two additional person-years will be required: one to finish
developing the automated computer system and the other to do routine
calibrations, maintain in house quality control, and maintain inventory.
Equipment costs are estimated to be about \$130,000 for each of two
years.

3. **ADCLs:** To set up laboratories for calibrating instruments to measure
air kerma from mammography units, it is estimated that each ADCL will
need at least \$100,000 for equipment and a person to operate the
calibration facility. Two of the ADCLs have expressed an interest in
developing mammography calibration facilities.

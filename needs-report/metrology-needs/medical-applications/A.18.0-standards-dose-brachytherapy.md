# `A.18.0` Air Kerma Standards for Ir-192 and Electronic Brachytherapy Sources

## Actions

- [ ] Manufacturers should be encouraged to work with NIST and secondary
calibration laboratories to establish air-kerma standards for their sources.
CIRMS can provide a channel for communication between the industrial sector and
the academic/national laboratory setting.

## Background

In the early 2000s several new miniature electronic brachytherapy sources
emerged for the treatment of interstitial, intercavitary, and surface
malignancies.

Electronic brachytherapy sources used in the United States commonly use
miniature x-ray tubes to generate a low-energy (70 kVP or below) bremsstrahlung
spectra. Recently, one manufacturer of a miniature x-ray source (Xoft, a
subsidiary of iCAD, Palo Alto, CA) worked with National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) to establish a standard for their source. However no other
miniature x-ray sources have a national standard. The current air-kerma standard
available for the Xoft miniature x-ray source has prepared the groundwork for
establishing additional standards. The present standard utilizes a
free-air-chamber (FAC) mounted on a rotating arm to assess the air-kerma as well
as source anisotropy.

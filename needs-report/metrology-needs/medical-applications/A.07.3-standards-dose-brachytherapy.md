# `A.07` Absorbed Dose Standards for Brachytherapy Sources

- [x] **Completed on March 19, 2014**

## Objective

- [x] Develop NIST traceable absorbed dose standards for diverse brachytherapy
  sources:

  - `A.07.3a` Low dose-rate photon sources
  - `A.07.3b` High dose-rate sources, as iridium-192
  - `A.07.3c` Neutron brachytherapy
  - `A.07.4d` Electronic brachytherapy

## Actions

- [x] Using three different detector systems, continue to characterize
their reliability in measure dose from different brachytherapy sources.

- [x] Adapt detector housings and software to enhance absorbed dose
measurements for each of the different brachytherapy sources.

- [x] Sustain sufficient NIST and industry support to complete the
objectives of this MPD.

## Requirements

- [x] A minimum of 4 person-years per year over the next three year time
period is required to sustain efforts in this area with personnel being
provided by both NIST and its industry partner.

## Background

Brachytherapy sources are coming into wider use for such applications as
prostate implants and breast treatments. Presently, NIST offers air-kerma
calibrations for these sources. Conversion of the air-kerma strength to a three
dimensional dose-distribution in a medium is a long process, involving Monte
Carlo analysis and in-air measurements of anisotropy and spectra. Radiochromic
film is a convenient tool for some of this work, but requires construction of
precise phantoms for each source geometry. Direct measurement of the dose-rate
by an ionization chamber in a medium is a more direct method and would serve to
tie together the theoretical modeling and the in-air measurements. It will also
enable a direct measurement of source anisotropy.

With the increasing acceptance of implants as a leading method of treating
cancer as well as a number of common non-cancerous conditions, the brachytherapy
source manufacturers are responding by creating new source designs to compete
for a part of the large market. Direct measurement of new source designs offers
the advantage of increased accuracy and shorter validation times for clinical
applications.

An alternative device for brachytherapy applications is a miniature X-ray
generator. This device allows radiation to be delivered to small volumes of
tissue through a needle-like applicator that can be inserted into the target
tissue. Procedures for calibration of this device must be developed and
implemented before it can be used in the clinic.

To appropriately address these needs, NIST must have source capabilities
equivalent to each of the brachytherapy modalities noted above: a) low dose-rate
photon sources; b) high dose-rate sources, as iridium-192; c) neutron
brachytherapy sources; and d) an electronic brachytherapy source.

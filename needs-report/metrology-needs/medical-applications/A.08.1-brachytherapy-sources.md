# `A.08.1` Liquid Based and Micro-Brachytherapy Sources

## Objective

**Develop a NIST traceable standard for liquid-based brachytherapy sources, and
micro-brachytherapy sources, and transfer this standard to the ADCLs.**

## Actions

- [ ] Adopt the “brachytherapy” model for calibration, assay and dosimetry of
liquid-based and micro-brachytherapy sources rather than the “nuclear medicine”
model.

- [ ] Establish a system for calibration of dose calibrators by the ADCLs for
liquid-base and micro-brachytherapy sources.

- [ ] Advance the quantitative, image-based dosimetry for liquid-based
brachytherapy and micro-brachytherapy and conduct a consensus building workshop
to cover this topic.

- [ ] Study the conversion from “contained activity” to “emitted radiation”
standards for liquid-based and micro-brachytherapy.

## Requirements

- [ ] A minimum of 2 person-years per year over the next three year time period
is required to launch into these objectives. Some partnerships between NIST and
industry are warranted in this area.

## Background

Liquid based and micro-brachytherapy sources are coming into wider use for
therapy applications. Recently, NIST developed a “nuclear medicine” standard
based upon a contained activity measurement. However, such an activity
measurement is not sufficiently precise for use in radiation therapy. A
preferred standard would consist of a statement of the emitted radiation from
the source.

A critical need in this area is a technique to transfer the calibration from the
assay of a sample of an unsealed radioactive source, to the calibration of the
unsealed source in the environment used for treatment. In some cases, the
unsealed source is introduced by a catheter into a balloon, which is implanted
into the target tissue. The effect of the balloon, as well as the specific
geometry of the unsealed source, must be addressed.

# Computational Needs

The use of mathematical modeling underlies many of the diverse uses involving
ionizing radiation. The Ionizing Radiation Division in the Physics Laboratory at
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been a pioneer in
the development of codes widely used in such modeling. These codes are used in
medical, industrial and radiation-protection applications. At NIST, Monte Carlo
calculations for dosimetry are cross-checked with ionizing radiation
measurements. NIST graphite-wall cavity-ionization chambers serve as the
national standard for air-kerma (radiation exposure). Wall corrections obtained
from Monte Carlo calculations will adjust air-kerma standards world-wide by up
to about 1%. Accurate measurements and calculations of absorbed dose play a
significant role in industry, ensuring adequate dose in radiation processing
(medical device sterilization, biological agent deactivation, etc.). In medical
applications, assessing dose rate accurately is critical to effective treatment
planning and fulfilling regulatory constraints.

Recognizing this broad-based use of computational methods, a Measurement Program
Descriptions has been modified to express current computational needs.

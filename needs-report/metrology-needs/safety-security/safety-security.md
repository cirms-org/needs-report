# Radiation Protection and Homeland Security

Through the first three CIRMS *Needs Reports* (1994, 1998 and 2001), CIRMS
maintained a distinction between the subcommittees on Public and Environmental
Radiation Protection (PERP) and Occupational Radiation Protection (ORP).
Measurement program descriptions (MPDs) were generated by both of these
subcommittees: PERPs were designated with a `B` and ORPs with a `C`. Numerical
designations came out of line as different MPDs were generated. One has to go
back to these earlier reports which can be found on the CIRMS web site to see
these. By the 2004 *Needs Report,* CIRMS had melded the PERP and ORP
subcommittees into one and augmented their needs with a growing need for
metrology as required by the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.

Background information on PERP and ORP, taken from the fourth *Needs Report*
(2004) can be found in Appendix F and in the history of CIRMS, Appendix B. The
new subcommittee combining the original PERP, ORP and Homeland Security seeks to
maintain the MPDs listed below.

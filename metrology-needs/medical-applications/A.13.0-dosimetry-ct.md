# `A.13.0` Enhanced Dosimetry Systems for CT Scans

## Objective

- Develop a coherent dosimetry system based upon NIST traceable dosimeters which
can be used routinely in the administration of CT scans.

## Actions

- [ ] In conjunction with the AAPM and the ACR, standards, such as those
developed for equipment through the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), have to be established for CT equipment. Such
standards should include the use of NIST traceable dosimeters and
phantoms that have a high degree of dose sensitivity.

- [ ] Relying upon its existing database in the Medicare/Medicaid system,
the Department of Health and Human Services can begin to establish a
database annotating how often an individual is to have a CT-scan.
Radiologists need to be informed as to how often a given patient has
been subjected to this procedure.

- [ ] Interact with ACR to see to develop standards for organ dose to make
good use of the data that they are already accumulating in their dose
register.

## Requirements

- [ ] A coordination team of representatives of the appropriate associations
(NIST, FDA CDRH and DHHS) will take several years to implement this need.

## Background

The enhanced image quality of X-ray generated computerized tomography (CT scans)
has lead to a growing use of this diagnostic method in the medical community.
For the most part, radiologists conducting CT scans rely upon protocols
established by the manufacturers of the CT scanning equipment to set exposure
parameters. Supposed corrections are made for body weight and bulk. Because this
diagnostic procedure can sometimes lead to the detection of undesired health
issues, i.e. detection of cancers, patients can be prone to seek multiple
CT-scans from different facilities, shopping around while in denial of an
unfavorable result. Studies have shown that excessive, multiple CT scans can
themselves be a source of radiation induced malignancies.

To ensure patient safety, industry standards for CT scanning equipment have to
be established and then administered by appropriate authorities, such as the US
Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Reliance upon vendor generated protocols does not assure patient safety. In
conjunction with this, a database has to be established within the Department of
Health and Human Service which will catalog patient exposures with due respect
to individual patient privacy rights. Radiologists need to be informed prior to
administering a CT scan of how many times a given patient has had this
procedure.

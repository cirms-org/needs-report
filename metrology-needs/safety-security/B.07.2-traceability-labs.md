# `B.07.2` Traceability to NIST for Reference, Monitoring and Service Laboratories

## Objective

- Develop a national approach, consistent with ANSI N42.23, for reference,
monitoring, and service laboratories to establish and maintain traceability to
NIST

- Establish NIST traceability for the reference laboratories of sponsored
performance evaluation programs

## Actions

NIST should establish a steering committee comprised of NIST and government and
commercial laboratory stakeholders. It should work closely with the working
group that is being established to revise the current version of ANSI N42.23.
This steering committee should focus on:

- [ ] Recommending the program elements required at NIST to support a
consistent national approach to Measurement Assurance, and facilitate the
necessary working relationship between NIST, reference, monitoring and service
laboratories and the administrating agency. b) Developing a “needs” table of
sample matrix, radionuclides, media type and analyte concentration level. Test
matrices would have to be specific to the needs of each program. These MAPs
will vary greatly, from drinking water standards, to radiobioassay standards,
to soil samples, to emergency responder tests. The levels needed would also be
program specific.

- [ ] Developing guidelines for the development of measurement quality
objectives for the preparation and distribution of performance testing
samples by NIST and the reference laboratories.

- [ ] Developing guidelines and criteria for sample preparation procedure
verification and validation applicable to test matrices and analyte
concentrations prepared by NIST or the reference laboratories.

- [ ] Establishing common testing requirements for NIST traceability
between NIST and the reference /participating laboratories.

- [ ] Developing quality assurance assessment criteria for conducting
onsite assessments of the reference laboratories.

- [ ] Developing a consistent mechanism for funding NIST support of a
national approach to MQA involving government and private testing
laboratories.

- [ ] Make recommendations on resources at NIST that would be needed to
adequately support this effort. These might include but are not limited
to: additional scientific and staff, expanded measurement capabilities,
dedicated laboratory facilities, and additional programmatic oversight
and management.

## Requirements

- [ ] For the Radiochemical Intercomparison Program (NRIP), three full-time
employees or contractor equivalent at NIST are needed for program
administration, development of the necessary technical capability and the
preparation and analysis of the test samples of the programs. The scientists
will also be responsible for the development and maintenance of the
radioanalytical procedures, and the development of the test sample preparation
and verification protocols.

- [ ] Sufficient and dedicated laboratory facilities and resources to conduct
the radioanalytical portion of the programs.

- [ ] Maintenance of calibrated nuclear instrumentation and primary test
solutions for the conduct of the programs.

- [ ] Sufficient resources for programmatic oversight and management to update
the programs and meet the communities needs.

### Note

In the CIRMS “Second Report on National Needs in Ionizing Radiation
Measurements and Standards,” published in October, 1998, this MPD appeared as
MPD `B.1` A new MPD number has been assigned, `MPD B.7`, to avoid confusion
with MPD `B.1` that had appeared in the first CIRMS “Report on National Needs
in Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards,” published in January, 1995,
that covered a different topic.

## Background

The term “traceability” has become a complex concept having subtle differences
in meaning depending on the specific application and the organization effected.
In 1996, as a result of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
process, a national standard was developed for the purpose of clarifying a
process of how laboratory measurements can become traceable to NIST. The
standard ANSI N42.22–1995, entitled “Traceability of Radioactive Sources to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Associated Instrument
Quality Control,” was primarily developed to address the needs of the
commercial radioactive source manufacturers related to NIST traceability for
the materials that they manufacturer, produce or sell. However, the guidance
and concepts provided within the standard are applicable to any organization
preparing radioactive materials that desires to be traceable to NIST. ANSI
N42.23-1996 was developed to address a national concern to establish a national
approach to measurement assurance for the radioassay laboratory community,
especially for the environmental and bioassay applications. This standard,
entitled “Measurement and Associated Instrumentation Quality Assurance for
Radioassay Laboratories,” was published in 1997 after nearly ten years of
preparation. The purpose of the standard was to provide the basis for the
creation of a national measurement quality assurance (MQA) process to support
the optimization of the quality of radioassays performed by service
laboratories in the United States. Within the framework of the national MQA
program description is the delineation of the responsibilities and interaction
of NIST, the accrediting/administering organization and the reference,
monitoring and service laboratories.

# `D.09.x` [DRAFT] Resource Gammacell 220 Irradiators

## Objective

- Establish a roadmap to resource Gammacell 220 irradiators.

## Actions

- [ ] Establish strategy:

  1. Develop agreements, contracts or indemnification documents such as
liability wavers from at least NIST and preferably from other national
labs to Nordion (or some other corporate entity) to enable resourcing
(replenishing) of Gammacell 220 irradiators, which serve as a critical
piece of the US primary standards process and help maintain traceability
standards; **or**

  1. Provide a national strategy to update US infrastructure in regards to
self-contained gamma irradiators; **or**

  1. At a minimum, provide a reasonable protocol for academia, labs and
industry for the disposal of partially depleted cobalt-60 sources in existing
Gammacell 220 irradiators

- [ ] Avoid overreactin to regulations surrounding cesium-137 and cobalt-60
sources and provide a forum for proper education about lifecycle management
including upfront and ongoing costs (money, time, personnel, liability), safety
and ongoing traceability.

## Requirements

- [ ] Minimal funds; moderate complexity; logistics and decision makers must
agree that this is a viable near-term approach.

- [ ] Moderate funds; high complexity; depending on scale, the cost to redesign
Gammacell 220 irradiators to meet modern needs and enable better future
resourcing would likely require upfront investment on the order of 10 million
dollars and a long-term commitment to support ongoing research efforts and
ongoing regulatory support concerning distributed gamma cells at labs, and in
academia

- [ ] Moderate funds; unknown complexity

## Background

For business reasons, Nordion (Sterigenics), has withdrawn resourcing support
for current Gammacell 220 irradiators. There exist myriad Gammacell 220
irradiators across North America that face limited options for resourcing (i.e.
replenishing cobalt-60 sources) inside the cells. Some of these irradiators are
located in academia and national labs such as at NIST. Maintaining traceability
to primary standards at NIST is a major concern so as not to impede commerce.
Maintaining research capabilities at national labs and academic sites is of
secondary near-term concern, but critical to maintain long-term US
competitiveness in research areas concerning ionizing radiation.

Suggested needs for next generation self-contained irradiators:

- Uniform calibration volume with dose control and measurement validation at 1 cm spacing
- Temperature range of âˆ’75 C to 75 C with 1 C temperature accuracy
- Dose control within 3% for industry, and within less than 2% for NIST
